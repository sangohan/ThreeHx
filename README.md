=======

Haxe/NME/OpenFL port of Three.js 3D library

Started as fork of https://github.com/eskojones/ThreeHX but this one was based on 
old Three.js version, so I ended up rewriting almost everything from scratch
based on Three.js r64.

https://github.com/threeDart/three.dart is very usefull for anyone who would like
to try to bring this port to life :)

WebGLRenderer brings a lot of challange to completing this port...
